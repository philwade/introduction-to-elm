# What is it
like react, V in MVC
haskell like syntax, not quite haskell (type classes)
currently 0.18, used by a couple smaller companies as part of their code base

# Why do you care

## speed
haskell compiler optimizes away your bad decisions
no preact, but it would be fun to test, speed test is open source

## error free
basically guarantees no runtime errors
if you can get it to compile, it will likely work
because of the typing, packages can't break you
potential for errors with javascript interop

## fun
declaractive, react like
virtual dom
shared state - redux, flux
static typing and referential transparency makes refactoring what you've written easy
even if you don't plan on writing it, it's relevant to react, redux and what's happening in the ui dev world


## basics
let's talk through some of the syntax concepts first
